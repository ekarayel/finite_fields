\title{Finite Fields}
\author{Emin Karayel}
\maketitle

\abstract{This entry contains a complete classification of the finite fields, in particular that
\begin{itemize}
\item the size of every finite field is a prime power,
\item for each prime power there is at least one finite field of that size, and that
\item any two finite fields of the same size are isomorphic.
\end{itemize}
The proof includes a formalization of the characteristics of rings, the Frobenius homomorphism, 
formal differentiation for polynomials in HOL Algebra and Gauss formula for the number of
monic irreducible polynomials over finite fields:
\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{d | n} \mu(d) p^{n/d} \textrm{.}
\]
The proofs are based on the books from Ireland and Rosen \cite[Chapter 7]{ireland1982}, as well as,
Lidl and Niederreiter\cite{lidl1986}.
